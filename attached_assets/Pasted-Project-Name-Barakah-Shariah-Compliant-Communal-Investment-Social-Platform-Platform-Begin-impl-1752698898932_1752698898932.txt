Project Name: Barakah – Shariah‑Compliant Communal Investment & Social Platform
Platform: Begin implementation in Replit (React Native or Flutter) for rapid prototyping.
Target Audience: Indian Muslim middle‑class community

1. Architecture & Tooling

Use React Native (Expo) or Flutter in Replit for a cross‑platform mobile build.

Set up a mock backend (e.g. Replit’s built‑in database or Firebase emulator) with JSON endpoints for fund data, NGOs, forums, mosque locations.

Include user authentication & KYC stub workflows.

2. Bottom Navigation Bar

Fixed at bottom on every screen. Five evenly spaced icons labeled:

Home (house icon)

Invest (coin-stack icon)

Dashboard (center, highlighted – chart icon)

Community (chat-bubble icon)

Profile (user-avatar icon)

Active icon uses Gold accent (#C9A66B) on Dark Olive (#3A4A32); inactive icons in charcoal (#2B2B2B).

Commit early & preview on your device/emulator within Replit.
